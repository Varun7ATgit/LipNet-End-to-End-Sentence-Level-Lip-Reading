**LipNet – End-to-End Sentence Level Lip Reading**
An end-to-end deep learning system that performs sentence-level lip reading by analyzing human lip movements from video and converting them into meaningful text using CNN + RNN based architectures.
This project focuses on improving accessibility for the hearing-impaired and enabling automated video transcription through computer vision and deep learning.

**Overview**
LipNet is a deep learning–based visual speech recognition model that predicts complete sentences from silent video clips by reading lip movements. The system combines:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – for spatial feature extraction from video frames
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – for temporal sequence modeling
3. Sequence learning techniques to produce sentence-level predictions
The project aims to bridge communication gaps and enhance human–computer interaction through visual speech understanding

**Objectives**
Build an end-to-end LipNet model to accurately transcribe spoken language from lip movements
